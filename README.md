# US Visa appointment (Canada) checker

The script automates the visa appointment checking.

Note: This tool can only be used for checking the US visa appointment in US Canada consulates.

## Status of the project
This is not a scalble/maintainable solution since it has been built in a very short time-frame. It is for personal use only!

## Environment

Linux/MacOS + NodeJS 16

If you don't have NodeJS envirement, install it through: https://nodejs.org/en/

## Config

You have to config the tool by editing the configuration file at ./.config.json

The config uses JSON format, so please follow the standard JSON format.

```json
{
    "schedule_id": "8 digits id", // You can find your schedule id by clicking the green "Continue" button localted on top right of the web page. (You will see it once you successfully logged in.)
    "alert_for_appointment_before": "2022-12-08", // Set a date of your current appointment date. The script will play beep-beep-beep-beep-beep once it finds an early appointment.
    "location": "vancouver", // The location should be one of the the following options: vancouver, calgary, ottawa, toronto.
    "username": "username", // Your usvisa-info username.
    "password": "password" // Your usvisa-info password.
}
```

## Install dependency

Run the command
```bash
npm install
```

## Run script
Once you start the script, it will check the appointment every 10 minutes (don't recommend to change since your account could be blocked if you check too often)

```bash
./check-appointment.js
```
